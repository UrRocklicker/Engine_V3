I intend to use this as a starting point for recreating basic old games (pong, snake, tetris, etc) in order to learn to program
Prebuilt game engines are useful for game design, but I feel you don't learn as much as you should, leading to shoddy code and inefficient systems.
In its current state, all it can do is display textures and move a character around with keyboard inputs, with some collision detection.
I've learned how pointers work, how to use the windows API to directly communicate with the OS, and I have a better understanding of the structure of a program.
